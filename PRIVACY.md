# Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how the "Markdown to PDF" GitHub Action (the "Action") handles user data.

The Action is designed to be a self-contained tool that runs directly on GitHub's servers as part of your repository's workflow. It does not send any user data, files, or configuration settings to an external server or to the developer of this Action.

## 1. Data Collection:

The Action does not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Data.

It operates solely on the files and data available within the GitHub repository where the Action is run.

The Action does not use cookies, web beacons, or any other tracking technologies.

## 2. Data Processing:

The Action's sole purpose is to process Markdown files and convert them into PDF documents.

This processing occurs entirely within the GitHub Actions environment, which is controlled and managed by GitHub.

All data processing is temporary and limited to the duration of the workflow run. Once the workflow is complete, the data and any intermediate files are removed from the runner environment.

## 3. Data Sharing:

The Action does not share any data with the developer or any third parties.

## 4. Data Security:

Since the Action does not collect or store data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access by the developer.

The security of your data is governed by the security measures and policies of GitHub, as the processing takes place on their infrastructure.

## 5. Your Choices and Rights:

Because no personal data is collected or stored by this Action, there are no choices or rights for you to exercise with the developer regarding your data. Your control over your data is managed through your GitHub account settings and repository permissions.

## Questions
For any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the Action's GitHub repository.
